## YAWA â€“ Yet Another Web Application.

YAWA is a web application that will provide users with an anonymous, geolocation-based posting service. It will enable users to create and comment on threads in their general geographic vicinity.

As many of our group members remember using Yik Yak at its height ~5 years ago, this project was important to us since no other service has filled the void that Yik-Yak has left, and our project aimed to emulate a simple, yet very approachable incarnation of that platform.
